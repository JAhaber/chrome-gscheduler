- A list of all notes sometimes fails to save some of them to Genome
- No error messages when a task fails to save (due to halted project, no access, etc)
- All billable tasks being set to "do not bill to client" (not an actual issue currently as the field has no effect)
- Drag and drop url into GScheduler
- Style update:
	.TaskButtons.open {
		max-height: calc(65% - 141px);
		height: 200px;
	}
